## Gender classifier for danish names

Description

The function uses the official danish lists of male, female and unisex first names to classify names as either male, female or unisex. If a name can not be determined as either one of those three it will return as NA.

Examples

```{r}
library(namesDK)
gender("Lars Løkke Rasmussen")
gender(c("Helle Thorning Smidt", "Lars Løkke Rasmussen", "Traktor Troels"))
```
